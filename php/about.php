                <p>
                    Due to Covid and its ramifications both socially and economically, depression has been on a steady rise since early 2020. 
                    Due to this increase, it has also become increasingly hard to find available emotional and medical support. 
                    This led to an increase in demand, but lack of supply has left a lot of people feeling helpless or stranded, causing a significant decrease in quality of life. 
                    We hope our website can remove the fear and hesitation from starting conversations about mental health and substance use and
                    allows you to post and view related topics so that you can quickly get help from a certified therapist or from someone who may be going through 
                    the same struggles.

                <p>
                    Our target is people who are struggling with mental disorders, emotional support, and substance abuse and is made for those who do not have a
                    platform or the resources to seek help. Having an open and anonymous forum creates a safe space for all since it allows you to share your experiences and learn from someone else's story.

                <p>
                    Web Therapy was created in 2022 by Ian Seto, Cuong Le, Spencer Janse, and Will Tran. We wanted to create a website that would be able to provide help to others. 
                    We also wanted our website to focus on emotional health and mental disorders since we believe it is a significant issue in America today.
